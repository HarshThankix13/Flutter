// 41. What happens when a class implements two interfaces and both declare a field (variable) with the same name?
// If a class implements two interfaces, and both interfaces declare a field with the same name, Dart does not consider it an issue. The class must provide an implementation for the field, satisfying both interfaces. The field in the class effectively becomes a single field that fulfills the requirements of both interfaces.

// 42. Can a subclass instance method override a superclass static method?
// No, a subclass instance method cannot override a superclass static method. Method overriding is a concept related to instance methods, not static methods. In Dart, static methods are associated with the class itself, and they are not inherited or overridden in the same way as instance methods.

// 43. Can a subclass static method hide a superclass instance method?
// Yes, a subclass static method can hide a superclass instance method if they have the same name and signature. This is known as "hiding" rather than "overriding." When a subclass declares a static method with the same name as an instance method in its superclass, it hides the superclass method but does not override it. The method to be invoked depends on the type of reference used to call the method.

// 44. Can a superclass access subclass member?
// No, a superclass cannot directly access members (fields or methods) of its subclass in Dart. The direction of access is always from the subclass to the superclass. Subclasses inherit from superclasses, but superclasses do not have direct access to the members of their subclasses.

// 45. Difference between object-oriented and object-based languages.
// Object-Oriented Language:

// Supports all major features of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
// Examples: Java, C++, Python, Ruby.
// Provides support for creating classes, objects, and implementing complex relationships.
// Object-Based Language:

// Lacks certain features of object-oriented programming, usually missing either inheritance or polymorphism or both.
// Examples: JavaScript.
// Supports objects and encapsulation but may not fully support inheritance or polymorphism.
